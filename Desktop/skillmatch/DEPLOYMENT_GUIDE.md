# SkillMatch Database Fixes & Sample Data Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the account deletion fixes and comprehensive sample data to your SkillMatch application.

## üö® Important: Account Deletion Fix

The account deletion issue has been fixed. Users will now be properly logged out and unable to login after account deletion.

## üìã Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Fix Account Deletion (CRITICAL)

1. **Open your Supabase SQL Editor**
2. **Run the account deletion fix script:**
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the contents of account_deletion_fix.sql
   ```
3. **Verify the fix worked:**
   - The function should now properly delete the auth user
   - Users will be logged out immediately after deletion
   - Deleted accounts cannot be used to login again

### Step 2: Add Comprehensive Sample Data

1. **Run the sample data insertion script:**
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the contents of sample_data_insertion.sql
   ```
2. **This will add:**
   - 100+ skills across multiple categories (programming, frontend, backend, cloud, etc.)
   - 10 sample companies with realistic data
   - 10 diverse job postings with full details
   - 10 candidate profiles with realistic information
   - Job-skill relationships for better matching

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

1. **Check your database tables:**
   ```sql
   -- Verify skills were added
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM skills;
   -- Should show 100+ skills
   
   -- Verify companies were added
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM companies;
   -- Should show 10 companies
   
   -- Verify jobs were added
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM jobs;
   -- Should show 10 jobs
   
   -- Verify user profiles were added
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_profiles WHERE role = 'job_seeker';
   -- Should show 10 candidate profiles
   ```

2. **Test account deletion:**
   - Create a test account
   - Delete the account
   - Verify you cannot login with that account again
   - Verify you are logged out immediately

### Fixed Account Deletion

**Before:**
- Users could still login after "deletion"
- Account data was deleted but auth user remained
- Inconsistent logout behavior

**After:**
- Auth user is properly deleted from `auth.users` table
- Users are immediately logged out
- Deleted accounts cannot be used to login again
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## üîß Technical Details

### Account Deletion Function
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delete_user_account(p_user_id UUID)
RETURNS JSON AS $$
-- Deletes all user data AND the auth user
-- Prevents login after deletion
-- Returns proper success/error messages
$$;
```

### Frontend Changes
- Enhanced error handling in `AuthContext.jsx`
- Improved user feedback in profile deletion
- Force logout after account deletion
- Better navigation handling

## üöÄ Benefits

1. **Better Demo Experience:**
   - Rich sample data for all user types
   - Realistic job postings and candidate profiles
   - Comprehensive skill database

2. **Proper Account Management:**
   - Users can truly delete their accounts
   - No orphaned auth users
   - Consistent logout behavior

3. **Enhanced User Experience:**
   - Clear feedback during deletion process
   - Proper error handling
   - Immediate logout after deletion

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Backup your database** before running these scripts
2. **Test the account deletion** with a test account first
3. **Verify all sample data** was inserted correctly
4. **Check that the application** works with the new data

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If account deletion still doesn't work:
1. Check if the function was created successfully
2. Verify the function has proper permissions
3. Check Supabase logs for any errors
4. Ensure the frontend is calling the correct function

### If sample data is missing:
1. Check for any SQL errors in the insertion script
2. Verify table structures match the expected schema
3. Check for any constraint violations
4. Run the verification queries to confirm data was inserted

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Supabase logs
2. Verify your database schema matches the expected structure
3. Test with a fresh database if needed
4. Contact support with specific error messages
