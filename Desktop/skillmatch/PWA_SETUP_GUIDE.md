# SkillMatch PWA Setup Guide

Your SkillMatch app is now configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA) and can be downloaded/installed by users! Here's what has been implemented and what you need to do:

## âœ… What's Already Configured

### 1. PWA Manifest (`public/manifest.json`)
- Complete app metadata with proper icons, shortcuts, and display settings
- Configured for standalone app experience
- Includes app shortcuts for quick access to key features
- Screenshots configuration for better app store presentation

### 2. Service Worker & Caching (`vite.config.mjs`)
- Auto-updating service worker via Vite PWA plugin
- Intelligent caching strategies:
  - **NetworkFirst** for Supabase API calls
  - **CacheFirst** for Google Fonts
  - Offline support for static assets

### 3. Install Prompt Component (`src/components/ui/PWAInstallPrompt.jsx`)
- Smart install banner that appears for eligible users
- Handles the `beforeinstallprompt` event
- User-friendly dismissal with 7-day cooldown
- Automatic detection of already-installed apps

### 4. Enhanced HTML Meta Tags (`index.html`)
- Proper PWA meta tags for all platforms
- Apple Touch Icon support
- Microsoft Tile configuration
- SEO-optimized metadata

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps Required

### 1. Create App Icons
You need to create these icon files in the `public/` folder:

```bash
# Required icon sizes
public/icon-192x192.png    # 192x192 pixels
public/icon-512x512.png    # 512x512 pixels
```

**Icon Requirements:**
- Use your SkillMatch logo/branding
- Square format with rounded corners optional
- High contrast, simple design works best
- PNG format with transparent background

**Quick Icon Creation Options:**
- Use tools like [PWA Builder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator) 
- Canva, Figma, or similar design tools
- AI image generators with "app icon" prompts

### 2. Optional: Add Screenshots
For better app store presentation, add these to `public/`:
```bash
public/screenshot-wide.png    # 1280x720 pixels (desktop view)
public/screenshot-narrow.png  # 640x1136 pixels (mobile view)
```

### 3. Test PWA Installation

**Desktop (Chrome/Edge):**
1. Visit your deployed app
2. Look for install icon in address bar
3. Click to install

**Mobile (Chrome/Safari):**
1. Visit app in browser
2. Look for "Add to Home Screen" option
3. Follow installation prompts

**Development Testing:**

Then test installation on localhost:4173
